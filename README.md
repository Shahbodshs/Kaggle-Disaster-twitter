# Kaggle twitter disaster competition
Hi, i attended to anoter competition in kaggle for beginners and i was able to do reach accuracy 82% with only 2 epochs. 
i could reach better accuracy but it needed much more time. 
Most of the codes from this file was copied from my other project: [Sentiment analysis with bert](https://github.com/Shahbodshs/Sentiment-analysis-bert).
